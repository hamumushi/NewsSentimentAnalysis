# NewsSentimentAnalysis

This notebook is based on [LSTM-Sentiment-Analysis](https://github.com/adeshpande3/LSTM-Sentiment-Analysis).
We obtain the model by Training.ipynb.
In this code, we use two word vectors to obtain the model. One is [GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), and the other is made from Thomson Reuters News Archive from 2003 to 2016 (8856M words).
Training.ipynb: RNN with LSTM units. Users select wordvector.
